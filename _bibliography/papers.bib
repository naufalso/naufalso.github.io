  abstract = {In modern automobiles, the reliance on vehicle Controller Area Network (CAN) networks has surged, underlining the paramount significance of safeguarding these networks against intrusions. In this work, we unveil an innovative approach for intrusion detection and explanation within in-vehicle CAN networks, employing the formidable synergy of Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Our method is tailored to address network imbalance challenges, offering prowess in binary and multiclass classification tasks. Integral to our approach is the seamless integration of SHAP values, serving as illuminating guides that unravel the intricacies of detected intrusions. This fusion elevates the system’s interpretability, equipping stakeholders with deeper insights. Our contribution is underpinned by a rigorous evaluation of our approach, featuring a comprehensive analysis of a published dataset alongside comparisons with established literature. The results underscore the exceptional efficacy of our method, showcasing its remarkable accuracy in detecting intrusions. However, the essence of our methodology transcends mere detection precision. The explanatory capabilities of SHAP values come to the forefront. This augments both understanding and decision-making into the contributing factors behind the detected intrusion classification model.},

  NUMBER = {5},

  ABSTRACT = {Blockchain technology is used to support digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and tokens. Commonly, smart contracts are used to generate tokens on top of the blockchain network. There are two fundamental types of tokens: fungible and non-fungible (NFTs). This paper focuses on NFTs and offers a technique to spot plagiarism in NFT images. NFTs are information that is appended to files to produce distinctive signatures. It can be found in image files, real artifacts, literature published online, and various other digital media. Plagiarism and fraudulent NFT images are becoming a big concern for artists and customers. This paper proposes an efficient deep learning-based approach for NFT image plagiarism detection using the EfficientNet-B0 architecture and the Triplet Semi-Hard Loss function. We trained our model using a dataset of NFT images and evaluated its performance using several metrics, including loss and accuracy. The results showed that the EfficientNet-B0-based deep neural network with triplet semi-hard loss outperformed other models such as Resnet50, DenseNet, and MobileNetV2 in detecting plagiarized NFTs. The experimental results demonstrate sufficient to be implemented in various NFT marketplaces.},
