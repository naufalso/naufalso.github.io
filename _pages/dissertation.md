<h2 style="text-align: center;">Synthesizing Robust Physical Camouflage for Universal 3D Evasion Attacks</h2>

<br>

### Abstract:
Adversarial camouflage has gained significant attention for its ability to disrupt object detectors from any viewpoint by covering the entire object's surface. However, due to the complexities of the physical domain and 3D rendering, existing methods are often tailored for a specific target, model, and environment, limiting their real-world applicability. This study introduces a novel framework for synthesizing universal and robust adversarial camouflage, enabling the concealment of 3D objects from deep learning-based computer vision models. Our framework incorporates innovative instance-agnostic differentiable texture rendering techniques, addressing differentiability issues and eliminating the need for specific UV mapping constraints, ensuring compatibility with diverse objects. Furthermore, we introduce a stealth loss to make the object completely undetectable rather than merely misclassified and a camouflage loss to enhance object concealment within the background. Our approach aims to create adversarial textures that can function universally across various perspectives, including instance, class, model, task, and domain agnostics.
